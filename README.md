# Boss Fight Game

## Overview

The Boss Fight Game is a simple 2D game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. This project was created to learn and practice object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and game development concepts.

**Note:**
The sprite art used in this project is not created by the author and is used for educational purposes only. This project is not intended for commercial use or profit.

## Features

- Player character with movement controls.
- A boss enemy with different phases and attack patterns.
- Health bars to track player and boss health.
- Damage indicators for visual feedback.
- Boss summoning minions in certain phases.
- Multiple boss attack patterns.
- Object-oriented architecture for modular code and easy maintenance.

## Game Elements

### Player

The player character is controlled by the user and can move freely within the game window. The player's objective is to defeat the boss enemy while avoiding its attacks.

### Boss

The boss is the main enemy of the game. It has different phases with varying attack patterns. The boss can move, attack, and summon minions during certain phases. The player's goal is to reduce the boss's health to zero to win the game.

### Minions

The boss can summon minions to aid in its attacks during specific phases of the game. Minions are enemy characters that follow the player and attempt to deal damage.

### Health Bars

The game features health bars for both the player and the boss, providing a visual representation of their current health status. The player must monitor their health bar to avoid defeat.

### Damage Indicators

When the player or boss takes damage, damage indicators briefly appear near the character to provide feedback on the amount of damage received.

## Object-Oriented Programming

This project heavily relies on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to organize and manage the game's complexity. Each game element, such as the player, boss, and minions, is implemented as a separate class with its own properties and methods. This approach allows for code reusability, modularity, and easier debugging.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python and the Pygame library installed.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.

## Controls

- Use WASD to move the player character.
- Use the right mouse button to perform player attacks.

## Acknowledgments

This project was created as part of a learning journey into object-oriented programming and game development. It serves as a practical application of OOP concepts and provides hands-on experience in designing and implementing a simple 2D game.
